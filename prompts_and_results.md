Prompt:
template3 = '''

Sentence: She is ugly.
Sentiment:____________
'''
Response:
Step 1: Identify the subject and predicate of the sentence.
Subject: She
Predicate: is ugly

Step 2: Determine the sentiment of the predicate.
The predicate "is ugly" is a negative statement, as it describes the subject (She) in an unfavorable way.

Step 3: Consider the overall sentiment of the sentence.
Since the predicate is negative and there are no other elements in the sentence that could change the sentiment, the overall sentiment of the sentence is negative.

Sentiment: Negative
